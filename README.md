# Korad-3005P-alternative-firmware

This is the initial commit of the alternative firmware written by "Tony Mach" in the eevblog forum. See original post here:

Important note:
The software "is as it is". It has NOT been tested by me. I just made this repo to make the software a little bit better available to people who are interested in  playing around with it.
For more (important!) information, please have a look at the forum thread linked above.
In the future I maybe plan to port the firmware to an STM32F103 controller because I don't have a development environment for the original controller.

Thanks a lot for sharing your work, Tony Mach!!!
